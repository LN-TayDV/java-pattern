/**
 * The {@code DegreesOfSeparation} class provides a client for finding
 * the degree of separation between one distinguished individual and
 * every other individual in a social network.
 * As an example, if the social network consists of actors in which
 * two actors are connected by a link if they appeared in the same movie,
 * and Kevin Bacon is the distinguished individual, then the client
 * computes the Kevin Bacon number of every actor in the network.
 * <p>
 * The running time is proportional to the number of individuals and
 * connections in the network. If the connections are given implicitly,
 * as in the movie network example (where every two actors are connected
 * if they appear in the same movie), the efficiency of the algorithm
 * is improved by allowing both movie and actor vertices and connecting
 * each movie to all of the actors that appear in that movie.
 * <p>
