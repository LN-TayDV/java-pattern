/**
 * The {@code DirectedCycleX} class represents a data type for
 * determining whether a digraph has a directed cycle.
 * The <em>hasCycle</em> operation determines whether the digraph has
 * a simple directed cycle and, if so, the <em>cycle</em> operation
 * returns one.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses a nonrecursive, queue-based algorithm.
 * The constructor takes time proportional to <em>V</em> + <em>E</em>
 * (in the worst case),
 * where <em>V</em> is the number of vertices and <em>E</em> is the
 * number of edges.
 * Each instance method takes &Theta;(1) time.
 * It uses &Theta;(<em>V</em>) extra space (not including the digraph).
 * <p>
 * See {@link DirectedCycle} for a recursive version that uses depth-first search.
 * See {@link Topological} or {@link TopologicalX} to compute a topological order
 * when the digraph is acyclic.
 * <p>
 * For additional documentation,
 * see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph">Section 4.2</a> of
